# Code repository for 7FNCE025W High Frequency Trading
The code is mainly based on the book 'Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading'. One of authors, Prof √Ålvaro Cartea, is my PhD supervisor. This code is just for teaching and learning purpose. It also can be found in another author Prof. Sebastian Jaimungal's personal website: http://sebastian.statistics.utoronto.ca/books/algo-and-hf-trading/code/
